# TicTacToeGame:
This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java.


Description:
The TicTacToe program allows two players to play the game of Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking spaces on the grid until one of them wins or the board is full resulting in a draw.
The program utilizes a command-line interface where players input their moves by entering the row and column numbers of the grid they want to mark.


How to Play:
1.	The program displays an empty Tic-Tac-Toe board.
2.	Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column numbers of the grid they want to mark.
3.	The game continues until one player wins or the board is full.
4.	A player wins if they have three of their marks (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal.
5.	If the board is full and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
